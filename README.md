# game_of_life
This is a game by John Conway in which houses on the grid can either live or die based on the amount of neighbors each space has.
This creates many interesting patterns which can be found here: http://conwaylife.com/

-Left Click/Drag to add houses
-Right CLick/Drag to delete houses
-You can edit the board while it is active (Yay for 2 threads)
-The speed slider will take into affect after you click pause and play (Working on making it instantaneous)
-The game is currently locked at 90*90 houses (Looking at possible ways for expansion repsective to a slider or stage dimensions)
